CFGit

I wish I could be more original with project names! Anyway ... this is just an
experiment I was playing around with tonight and just wanted to share. At the 
moment it is a rather bare bones CFC for talking to Git. You can run currently
on run:
* Status
* Log
* Show
The benefit (which is where the idea started) is that you don't have to be in
the git project to run this!

I've only tested on a Mac w/CF9 so would be glad for any feed back or updates!
